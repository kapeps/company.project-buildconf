# Layout. Note that the rock.base and orocos.toolchain sets are
# imported by other rock sets.
layout:
   - rock.core
   - rock.gazebo
   - control/orogen/cart_ctrl_wdls
   - control/orogen/robot_frames
   # Uncomment to enable the Rock/ROS bridge
   # You will also have to uncomment some lines in the package_sets above
   # - rock.ros
   # Uncomment to checkout and build all tutorials  
   # - rock.tutorials    

# Package exclusion: packages can be completely excluded from the build. This is
# an alternative way than using the layout.
#
# Useful if you want to enable a whole package set except a few packages, or if
# you want to exclude some package's optional dependencies.
#
# exclude_packages:
# - gui/.*

# Ignoring packages: assume that some packages are present on disk. Unlike
# exclude_packages, autoproj will not generate an error if a non-excluded
# package depends on an ignored one, but it will not include the package and its
# dependencies in the build.
#
# For instance, if one assumes that the 'rtt' package is already available on
# the machine *and* you're confident that picking it outside of the workspace
# won't create problems, then simply do:
#
# Note that using this obviously hinders repeatability of the build
#
# ignored_packages:
# - rtt
